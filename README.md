# Ants vs. Some-Bees

This module is a simple turn-based tower-defense game played on the command-line, created for the Software Architecture course at the UW iSchool.  The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!  

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Doc Comments from TypeDoc.org and an example done in class.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Probably around 5-6ish hours. It was mainly how to install the TypeDoc. I figured it out by installing it globally instead of local.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> Probably a 2. It was definitely easy, but I overthinking a lot of the documentation stuff to make sure I did it right. I thought maybe I added too much or too little on the comments, or I misunderstood how the function works.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> No problems encountered at all in this assignment.
